### **Student Project: Interactive Business Insights Using Plotly**
**Project Title:** *Exploring Business Data Trends with Interactive Visualizations in R*

---

### **Project Objective**  
Students will use **Plotly** in R to explore and visualize a business-related dataset, such as **sales data, customer behavior, or stock prices**. The goal is to create **interactive visualizations** to uncover patterns and insights.

---

### **Project Requirements**  
**Data Source:**  
Students can choose one of the following datasets or use their own business-related dataset:  
- **Built-in dataset:** `economics` (US economic data)  
- **CSV file:** Sales or financial dataset from Kaggle  
- **Google Trends data:** Exported from Google Trends  

**Tools:**  
- `plotly` for visualization  
- `dplyr` for data wrangling  

**Deliverables:**  
- **An R script** with interactive Plotly visualizations  
- **A brief report or presentation** summarizing insights  

---

### **Tasks and Guidelines**  

**1. Data Preparation**
- Load a business dataset (e.g., sales, economic data).
- Convert necessary variables into factors.
- Perform **basic data wrangling** (filtering, grouping, summarization).

**2. Visualization Tasks**  
**Scatter Plot:**  
- Create an **interactive scatter plot** showing the relationship between two key metrics (e.g., **sales vs. profit**).
- Use **color coding** to represent different categories.

**Bar Chart:**  
- Create a **bar chart** comparing **total sales per region or product category**.
- Use **stacked or grouped** bars.

**Line Chart:**  
- Create an **interactive line chart** showing trends over time (e.g., **monthly revenue**).

**Bubble Chart:**  
- Create a **bubble chart** where **bubble size represents total sales** and **color represents product categories**.

**Heatmap:**  
- Create an **interactive heatmap** showing correlations between numerical variables.

**3. Insights & Interpretation**  
- Summarize key **business insights** using the visualizations.
- Answer questions like:
  - Which product category or region generates the most revenue?
  - Are there seasonal trends in sales or economic indicators?
  - How are different variables correlated?

**4. (Optional) Interactive Dashboard**  
- If students want an extra challenge, they can integrate the plots into a **Shiny app** or **flexdashboard**.
