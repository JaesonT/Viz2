### **Student Project: Analyzing Vehicle Performance with Interactive Visualizations**
**Project Title:** *Exploring Car Performance Metrics Using Interactive Data Visualizations in R*

---

### **Project Objective**  
Students will analyze the **mtcars** dataset using **Plotly** in R to uncover insights about vehicle performance. They will create interactive visualizations to understand relationships between different car attributes.

---

### **Project Requirements**  
**Data Source:** Built-in **mtcars** dataset  
**Tools:** `plotly`, `dplyr`  
**Deliverables:**  
   - **R script** with data analysis and visualization  
   - **A short report or presentation** summarizing findings  
   - **A dashboard (optional) using flexdashboard or Shiny**

---

### **Tasks and Guidelines**  

**1. Data Preparation**
- Load the `mtcars` dataset.
- Convert categorical variables (`cyl`, `gear`) into factors.

**2. Visualization Tasks**  
**Scatter Plot:**  
- Create an interactive **scatter plot** of **MPG vs. Weight**, with color representing `cyl` (cylinders).
- Add **horsepower (hp) as the size** of the points.

**Bar Chart:**  
- Create a **stacked bar chart** showing the count of cars by `cyl` and `gear`.

**Bubble Chart:**  
- Create an interactive **bubble chart** visualizing **MPG vs. Horsepower**, with **weight as the bubble size**.

**Heatmap:**  
- Generate an interactive **heatmap** showing correlations between `mpg`, `hp`, `wt`, and `qsec`.

**Density Plot:**  
- Create a **2D histogram density plot** to examine the distribution of `MPG` and `HP`.

**3. Insights & Interpretation**  
- Summarize key findings from the visualizations.
- Answer questions like:
  - Which type of car (by `cyl`) tends to have better fuel efficiency (`mpg`)?
  - What is the relationship between `hp` and `mpg`?
  - How does weight (`wt`) impact fuel efficiency?

**4. (Optional) Interactive Dashboard**  
- If students want an extra challenge, they can integrate the plots into a **Shiny app** or **flexdashboard**.

### **Grading Criteria**
| Criteria | Points |
|----------|--------|
| Correct use of `plotly` for interactive visualizations | 30 |
| Clarity & accuracy of visualizations | 20 |
| Interpretation & insights from data | 20 |
| Report/Presentation quality | 20 |
| Bonus (Dashboard or additional insights) | 10 |

### **Expected Outcome**
By completing this project, students will develop skills in **interactive data visualization** and **data-driven storytelling**, which are highly valuable for business analytics.
